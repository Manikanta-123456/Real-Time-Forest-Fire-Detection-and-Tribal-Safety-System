# Real-Time Forest Fire Detection and Tribal Safety System

An IoT-based project that detects forest fires and hazardous gas leaks in real-time using ESP32, flame sensors, gas sensors, and temperature/humidity monitoring. The system ensures the safety of tribal communities by triggering local alerts and sending notifications via the Blynk IoT platform.

## 🔥 Features

- Real-time fire and gas detection using flame and MQ gas sensors
- Temperature and humidity monitoring via DHT11
- Automatic water spraying using a motor pump controlled via relay
- Instant mobile alerts using Blynk IoT platform
- Audible buzzer and LED alert system
- Modular and scalable design for larger forest coverage

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **ESP32 Microcontroller**
- **Flame Sensor**, **Gas Sensor (MQ)**, **DHT11 Sensor**
- **Buzzer**, **LED**, **Relay Module**, **DC Water Motor**
- **Arduino IDE** with Embedded C
- **Blynk IoT Platform**
- **Proteus** for simulation

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Manikanta-123456/Real-Time-Forest-Fire-Detection-and-Tribal-Safety-System.git
   ```

2. Open the `.ino` file in **Arduino IDE**
3. Connect your **ESP32 board** and select the correct COM port
4. Upload the code and monitor sensor values using **Serial Monitor**
5. Use the **Blynk app** to view real-time alerts

## 📱 Blynk Setup

- Add your **Auth Token**, **WiFi SSID**, and **Password** in the `.ino` file
- Create widgets on Blynk for displaying sensor values and notifications
